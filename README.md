## What is GoalStarter

Many students lack motivation to achieve their goals, whether it is dieting, exercising or studying. However, we have observed that positive reinforcement from other people and recording one's goals can give motivation to follow through with these goals. GoalStarter is a social media platform that is centred on posting and tracking goals. Users can post their goals, give updates, and react to each othersâ€™ progress. Users can share their experience with people on their friends list, or with people working on similar goals as categorized by the system. Non-trivial algorithms will suggest users to friends and determine the posts that the user wants to see. 

## Technologies Used

The front end is written in Java using Android Studio, and the back end is written using the Express.js web framework with MongoDB as the database.
